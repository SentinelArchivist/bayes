# Bayes: A Pick‑Up‑and‑Play Bayesian Reasoning App

Bayes is a simple, beautiful, and offline‑capable Progressive Web App (PWA) that helps anyone reason under uncertainty using Bayes’ Theorem. You enter your possible explanations (hypotheses), your initial guesses (priors), and how likely your evidence would be if each hypothesis were true (likelihoods). The app does the math, updates your beliefs as you add more evidence, and shows clean charts of the results.

- No coding required. Written for non‑experts.
- Handles many hypotheses, repeated updates, tiny probabilities (scientific notation), and uncertain evidence (Jeffrey conditionalization).
- Works fully offline on iPhone and Mac once installed.
- Tech stack: HTML/CSS/JS for the PWA; optional Python for reference algorithms and testing.

## Purpose and Promise

Our promise is clarity without complexity. The app avoids jargon, guides you step‑by‑step, and makes Bayesian reasoning approachable for everyday questions—from diagnostics and forecasting to day‑to‑day decision‑making.

## Status

This repository currently contains planning and specification documents. Implementation comes next following the project plan.
